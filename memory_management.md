# Memory Management

[Operating-System-Concepts]

* **paging** - a memory-management scheme allowing processâ€™s physical address space to be non-contiguous.

[Linux-System-Programming]

* processes do not directly address physical memory
* each process is associates with a (unique) _virtual address space_
* address space is _linear_ (start at zero) and _flat_

* **page** smallest addressable unit of memory by MMU (memory management unit)
  * page size is defined by the hardware
  * get pagesize via `/proc`, `getconf`, or syscall `getpagesize()`

    ```bash
    # cat /proc/1/smaps | grep -i pagesize | head -2
    KernelPageSize:        4 kB
    MMUPageSize:           4 kB
    # getconf PAGESIZE
    4096
    ```

    ```c
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main() {
       printf("%d\n", getpagesize());
    }
    ```
  * pages are either valid or invalid
    * _valid page_ - associated with a page of data (in RAM or secondary storage/swap)
    * _invalid page_ - not associated with anything (unused, unallocated address space)
  * **page fault**: - _valid_ page but not currently in RAM and needs to be _paged in_
  * **segmentation fault** - caused by trying to access an _invalid_ page
  ```c
    #include <stdlib.h>
    int main() {
      int *ip;
      ip = (int *) malloc( sizeof(int)*10 );
      ip[100000] = 99; // outside array's 10 elements, seg fault
    }
  ```

* memory regtions (areas/mappings) in every process
  * _text segment_ the actual program code, constants etc; ready only data
  * _data segment_ or _heap_ - dynamic memory (`malloc()`)
  * _bss segment_ unitialzed global variables (zeroes)
  * _stack_ grows/shrinks dynamically; e.g. local vars, function return data. Thread: one stack per thread

  ```sh
    $ ulimit -Sa | grep -i stack
    stack size                  (kbytes, -s) 8192
  ```

* **dynamic memory** - allocated at runtim
  * `void * malloc (size_t size);`
  * `calloc()` - zero's out bytes ('c'=clear)
  * `realloc()`
    > if unable to enlarge the existing chunk of memory by growing the chunk in situ,
    > the function may allocate a new region of memory size bytes in length,
    > copy the old region into the new one, and free the old region

* **anonymous memory mapping**
  * for large allocations, glibc doesn't use the heap; instead creates an anonymous memory mapping
  * `mmap()` creates a memory mapping and the system call `munmap()` destroys a mapping

* **advanced memory allocation**
  * `mallopt()` - sets the memory-management-related parameter e.g.
    * `M_MMAP_THRESHOLD` - malloc allocation request via an anonymous mapping instead of heap
    * default value (Linux) if not set for `M_MMAP_THRESHOLD` = 128k (128\*2024)

* **stack-based allocations**
  * one can use the stack for dynamic memory allocations too (as long as it doesn't overflow)
  * `alloca()` system call for dynanimc memory allocation from stack
    > alloca() returns a pointer to size bytes of memory.
    > This memory lives on the stack and is automatically freed when the invoking function returns.
    ```c
    #include <alloca.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    int main() {
      void *p;
      // int size = 8388608; /* will segfault as ulimit: stack size (kbytes, -s) 8192 */
      int size = 8388608 / 2;
      p = alloca(size);
      // free(p); /* will result in Aborted (core dumped) */
    }
    ```
  * very fast compared to `malloc()` (just increases stack pointer)

* **locking memory** - two situations you might want to change default paging behaviour:
  * (1) _determinism_ - page fault are costly b/c of I/O operations (disk)
  * (2) _security_ - if secrets kept in memory are paged out to (unencrypted) disk
  * `mlock()` - to locks a specific memory area/allocation, unlock with `munlock()`
  * `mlockall()` - locks the whole process space, unlock with `munlockall()`
